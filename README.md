# PDF-Attachment-in-Product-Description
Product data sheets can be a very useful tool in selling a product but trying to put all the specific details on a product page can take up just too much room.
With this mod, you can add a downloadable PDF to any product.
You can briefly explain each product but also provide those interested customers with the full specifications for that particular product.
You specify the text to appear on the product page. This text will show up below the product description with a PDF icon linking to the PDF download file.
